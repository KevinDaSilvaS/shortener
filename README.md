# shortener
Url shortener app made with Go and Gin in less than 8 hours of work that uses Redis as database

The main reason behind this project is only study purposes, and to follow my general a roadmap of learning a new language:

 - Learn language basics
 - Create a tictactoe game
 - Create a url shortener app(in general is a small app that provide the learning experience needed)
 
 The main challenge was the time to learn Gin and how to work with databases in Go in less than 8 hours and somehow manage to deliver something that works!
