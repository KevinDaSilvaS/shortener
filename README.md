# shortener
Url shortener app made with Go and Gin in less than 8 hours of work that uses Redis as database

The main reason behind this project is only study purposes, and to follow my general a roadmap of learning a new language:

 - Learn language basics
 - Create a tictactoe game
 - Create a url shortener app(in general is a small app that provide the learning experience needed)
 
 The main challenge was the time to learn Gin and how to work with databases in Go in less than 8 hours and somehow manage to deliver something that works!
 
 Also I had to learn how to install, manage and compile programs with external dependencies, wich generated a bit of trouble
 
 Now I guess I will have to add 10 years of experience in Go and Gin on my linkedin profile, to get to know a recruiter :P
